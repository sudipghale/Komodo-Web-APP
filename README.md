# Komodo-Web-Application
 Kpay, a web-based application prototype for the Komodo-Rust api, built using the Rocket, a rust
web application framework and bootstrap 4.0. Kpay is developed to test the major
functionalities of the Rust API including getbalance, sendmoney, listaddressgrouping, and getcontrolinfo.
Kpay uses the KennyCoin, a cryptocurrency build using the Komodo Daemon, as a
means to test transactions between users.
